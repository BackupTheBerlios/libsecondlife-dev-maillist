<PRE>How hard would it be to make a proxy server that
caches 100's of Gigs of textures for multiple clients?

Caching objects would also be nice. I see that there
is a checksum packet that could be used for this. :)

  I would rather see Grey ghosts for 30 seconds when
I enter a sim than nothing. If the cache did cache
objects it could send the objects to the client with
the grey texture UUID until it verifys that that
object still exists.

  LL may improve the client cache, but they are unlikely
to make a separate cache server (any time soon) that can
store 100's of gigs of storage space and can be used
by multiple clients at the same time.

--
I am also worried about texture theft, so I am thinking
that using simple encryption to encrypt the cache
and not releasing that part of the code. This would help
reduce issues like the AppThatMustNotBeNamed.

I know that releasing the encrypt/decrypt module in binary
form would not prevent all copying, but I think that LL will
inevitably encrypt everything.

--
I prefer multiple directory system and a &quot;manually ran&quot;
program that trims old data and sorts the objects in each file
You would then de-fragment the hard drive since this method will
fragment files as it goes.

The master &quot;UUID,resolution&quot; to &quot;dir,file,offset&quot; table could
get quite large, but keeping textures that are loaded at about
the same time in the same file would speed things up.

&quot;Sort as you go&quot; would work, but would be more tricky.
