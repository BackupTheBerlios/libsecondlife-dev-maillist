<PRE>We haven't officially made any hints about libsecondlife being ready for 
production use, but that hasn't stopped the early adopters. Yesterday 
the band Long Range did a concert in SL, and the technical workings were 
pretty interesting. The band was live in a studio streaming a Quicktime 
feed in-world with video and audio of the performance, but the band 
member avatars were operated by libsecondlife. The bots were programmed 
to login, hunt for their target pose stand and sit on it which would 
begin the animation. This is nothing different from the sit command in 
TestClient or some of the other code people have been working on, but 
the interesting part is that the concert was split up between 12 
identical sims synchronized together that all needed band members 
playing. Five band members times 12 sims is 60 libsecondlife bots, and 
they were all running from one server! There were a couple glitches with 
the appearances being sent out that I'm chalking up to network load 
issues (logging in 60 avs at the same time), but overall the concert(s) 
went really well. A video is available at:

The library is approaching production state, watch out for lots of cool 
things this month!
