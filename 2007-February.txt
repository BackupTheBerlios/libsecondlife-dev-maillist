Summary: Teleport still very buggy

Details: The Teleports are still very buggy. Very often (90%) the 500 and 502 error appears (bad gateway) and 99% of the times when you  try to teleport the whole client gets disconnected. It seems that the teleport always works the first time but after that first time it all change into a nightmare. 50% of the times it still shows up with the error: "Couldnt find region (name)"

Subject: [Libsecondlife-dev] [Bug #10292] Memory usage
Message-ID: <200702100656.l1A6uSto001794@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #10292, was updated on 2007-Feb-10 00:56

Summary: Memory usage

Details: The memory usage of the lib is pretty bad. The longer you run a program writen with this lib, the more "full" your memory gets till the point that the whole system is going to lockup and or doesnt respond anymore.
Not sure in what part this might be but this is an issue from the last 2 weeks (or less). I personal think that the lib keeps creating arrays for objects, avatars and or regions (or whatever) without releasing the old ones or something simulair.

I hope this helps
