<PRE>Tom,

Prokofy is one of the biggest and most successful trolls in Second Life.
Armed with a thesaurus and knowledge of political rhetoric such as
&quot;bolshevik displacement&quot;, her M.O. for winning arguments is to dump a
truckload of words on her opponents until they simply give up from sheer
exhaustion. I would recommend not muting her unless her communications
really get in your way. She has accused me of all manner of dickery in SL,
placed me at the core of many a conspiracy, etc. I'm pretty sure she
actually believes what she's saying, which is a little scary, but at the
end of the day all she has is a dump truck full of words, and words only
have power if you let them.

Ultimately, all she can do is type words at you. If you keep getting
questions from people about libSL, I would recommend creating a new Pick
in your profile and putting a statement in it, and pointing people there.
People shouldn't be mad at you for copybot, since you had nothing to do
with it, and it really isn't necessary for you to apologize for what
John/Baba/whoever did, since again, you weren't involved. In fact, almost
no one in the libSL project had a hand in the creation or distribution of
copybot. People are only mad at the entire group because they are
intellectually lazy.

Hope this helps.
