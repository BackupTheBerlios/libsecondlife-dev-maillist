Tom, I have never received a single IM from Prokofy and neither have any 
of my bots that are in the libsecondlife group, I think your virtual 
quarrels are between you and the person having them. I would venture to 
guess that ideas like &quot;fighting griefing&quot; and &quot;safe programming groups&quot; 
are probably baiting trolls. Just make it clear that you don't speak on 
behalf of libsecondlife in those kind of situations, if you choose to 
engage in dialog at all.

John
