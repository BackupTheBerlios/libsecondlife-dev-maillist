Subject: [Libsecondlife-dev] Licensing terms of svn code
Message-ID: <456D80A1.5060707@wsu.edu>

This is a followup to a conversation I saw in IRC regarding a Microsoft 
Shared Source licensed file in the repository (and it being removed in 
favor of homemade code). One of the early goals of the libsecondlife 
project was to lower the barrier to entry for anyone who wanted to use 
the code, whether it was a hobby developer or a large corporation. To 
help lower the barrier to entry we determined that all code the 
libsecondlife project distributes will be under a single, very liberal 
license, and this would be strictly enforced to prevent license 
confusion. The particular license in question (Microsoft Community 
License (Ms-CL)) is a fine license on it's own, but it demands that 
individual files licensed under Ms-CL stay Ms-CL. This creates another 
license in the code repository that potential developers have to review, 
determine what implications using that piece of code has, etc. To avoid 
turning the repository in to a legal minefield, the rule of thumb is if 
the license allows code to be relicensed under the BSD license then do 
it and commit it. If it's your own code then it must be under the same 
BSD license, but you keep the copyright to anything you write.

I hope I'm not jumping in front of the project leader with this, but the 
description above is the state of things at this moment.
