<PRE>I logged in and immediately got assailed with accusations. I'm now a liar,
John and Baba are criminals, and every person in the libSL group supports
griefers, according to Prokofy.

Oh yeah, John and Baba - Prok says you should publicly apologize, step down,
and quit submitting code to libSL.

However, one thing that Prok said is true: Baba's showing copybot around on
the grid and John selling not one but two different controversial programs
(God Mode and Copybot) has caused a lot of controversy. I'm not going to
call either one of them griefers or criminals, but John - I really wish you
hadn't been selling copybot. That made all of us look bad, and considering
the fact that you still haven't made a public apology for that, people
naturally assume that you're happy to profit from would-be griefers.

Perhaps it IS time for John and Baba both to step up, admit fault, take the
blame, and say &quot;we're sorry for the problems this caused. In the future, we
won't do this -  sell or distribute any test programs that can violate
someone else's IP&quot;. Don't get me wrong - I don't think Baba intended for
this to happen, but John had to know that selling CopyBot was a bad idea.

Before you think this is all in reaction to Prok, I've received quite a few
disparaging comments that brought my character in to question because I
supported you guys when I thought you hadn't done anyhthing wrong. Finding
out you HAD been selling copybot was like a slap in the face, and
considering the fact that I defended your honor and was proven wrong, not
once but twice, I'm a little upset.

Why didn't I say anything before? Quite frankly, I was hoping it would just
go away. But things like this most recent &quot;conversation&quot; just keep bringing
it back up. When someone says &quot;Why did you defend John, when he was the one
selling it?&quot; I don't have a good answer. All I can say is, &quot;I know he's
sorry,&quot; but I can't point to a single public place where John Hurliman steps
up and says &quot;Selling CopyBot was wrong, and I'm sorry I did it.&quot;

So now I'm beginning to be sorry that I believed in this group's leaders.
What do I do about that? I don't know yet, but this is a start.

</I>&gt;<i>  I've been getting IM's from Prokofy Neva, to the tune of about 30 or so,
</I>&gt;<i> telling me that I'm somehow responsible for griefers like W-Hat, because I'm
</I>&gt;<i> a member of the libSecondLife group within Second Life. I offered to talk to
</I>&gt;<i> him one on one, but he just kept telling me how my reputation is falling
</I>&gt;<i> because I'm associated with libSL, and that he will hold ME responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> the W-Hat griefing going on in his land.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This attitude is especially frustrating, considering the fact that I've
</I>&gt;<i> been the most outspoken about forming a group to find ways to fight griefing
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;unsafe&quot; programming involving third party SL programs and scripts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have others here had experience with Prokofy? Do you have suggestions for
</I>&gt;<i> how to talk to him to make him understand my position, or is he just going
</I>&gt;<i> to badger me until I miute him?
