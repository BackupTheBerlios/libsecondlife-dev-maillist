Heh, almost fell off my chair when you mentioned MS Access while talking 
about databases.

Although MS Access organizes data and functions as a &quot;database&quot; -- it's 
meant to be a tool for organizing relatively small amounts of personal 
data, while running in user space.  It has been horribly abused over the 
years in attempts to make it do much more then it was originally 
designed for.

Any trivially implemented attempt at a real database engine will vastly 
outperform MS Access, in nearly all respects.  Any well thought out and 
implemented attempt at a real database engine will show exactly how much 
of a &quot;toy&quot; MS Access is.

The major Open Source database engines (MySQL/Postgress) when properly 
configured can satisfy all of your requirements except possibly #4:

Requirements
   1. Muti-platform
   2. Free
   3. Fast
   4. Compiled in to application to prevent OS conflicts.
   5. Able to handle 1T byte on a low end PC (multiple drives)


A common shared SL Proxy may improve grid/sim performance by taking the 
load of delivering textures off the grid/sim -- which if used by enough 
people could improve grid performance.  I'm not so sure it would help 
improve the client's performance much though.  Could be useful if you 
had a Internet cafe or something in RL, where you had a large number of 
people in RL all visiting the same sim though.

All that said...  Making a caching proxy using SLProxy shouldn't take 
more then 10 or 20 hours of development time.  Probably much less then 
that, to get a &quot;functioning&quot; prototype built.
