Comment:
This patch appears to be missing parts, it references a "Bot" variable that doesn't exist in the latest svn of TestClient or in the patch.

I'm doing a slight architecture upgrade to TestClient to allow for data sharing between bot instances, so I'll modify this command to work with that and commit when it's finished.

Details: <@jhurliman> qz4200, we just started having that problem too after the latest SL patch. we may have to redo the logout code
 <@jhurliman> technically we are supposed to do LogoutRequest, wait for LogoutReply, then do FinalizeLogout. i think

I am using revision 677 now but I was getting the error in some previous
revisions as well.  Sorry if this is the wrong place to bring this up.

I committed some additional error catching facilities to ZeroDecode() 
that can help to catch this issue, can you run with the latest code and 
report back with the output? Also, what platform and OS are you on? 
Big/little-endian, and OSX/Linux/Windows?

I am now getting a new error with the new revision (685).
I am using Windows Vista and compiling with Visual Studio 2005 (8.0.50727.42).

I don't know if this could have a role in it but the program uses
several SecondLife clients at once and I have little bandwidth.

libsecondlife.Packets.MalformedDataException was unhandled
  Message="Error in the application."
  Source="libsecondlife"

Summary: Prim XML (De)serialization is Broken

Details: We have not yet been successful is deserializing a list of prims from XML. The serialization appears to work correctly and multiple prims are output in to a list along with all of their parameters, but when deserializing back in to a List<PrimObject> structure lots of error callbacks occur, failing on nearly everything that is not an attribute.

Maybe we have to generate an XSD (using xsd.exe included with the .NET 2.0 SDK) and use that for deserialization? More investigation is needed here.

Hi,

I attached a diff of some changes I made to
libsecondlife-dev at lists.berlios.de that allows nant to avoid
rebuilding everything everytime it is invoked.

Fixed in rev 694.

The problem was with LLUUID.ReadXml not moving the reader position up, so anything read after a uuid would be corrupt.

Summary: Resent packet flood and multiple callbacks after a few hours

Details: This bug has been discussed for a while now but no cause has been identified. After being connected to the grid for several hours, or a shorter timespan with more network traffic, the client will continually receive lots of resent packets over and over. Also during this time it appears that callbacks will fire multiple times for single events in SL such as a chat message.

Summary: Automatic updater system is unfinished

Details: We need the automatic updater system in place sooner rather than later, since it needs to have real-world testing that could take a few weeks before it goes in to production. The skeleton of the code is in svn, the basic idea is that it connects to a script on the libsecondlife.org web server that returns the latest version number and a download link for the latest version, and if the client version number (retrieved through reflection using the property in AssemblyInfo.cs) is older, signal to the calling program to quit, download the updated version and install it, launch the calling program again and close itself.

The other two parts of this are the web server script that identifies what the latest published build is (these will be published manually for now) and provides a direct download link to libsecondlife.dll, and updates to the ccnet build process to automatically increment the build number in AssemblyInfo.cs (major / minor / patch numbers will be updated by hand when it's desired).

Comment:
Turns out the sequence numbers are 24 bits, not 16. This has been fixed in the code and it appears to resolve this bug.

Message-ID: <c1d188e50612121236s2de6cae9se84508b010860734@mail.gmail.com>

I've been getting IM's from Prokofy Neva, to the tune of about 30 or so,
telling me that I'm somehow responsible for griefers like W-Hat, because I'm
a member of the libSecondLife group within Second Life. I offered to talk to
him one on one, but he just kept telling me how my reputation is falling
because I'm associated with libSL, and that he will hold ME responsible for
the W-Hat griefing going on in his land.

This attitude is especially frustrating, considering the fact that I've been
the most outspoken about forming a group to find ways to fight griefing and
"unsafe" programming involving third party SL programs and scripts.

Have others here had experience with Prokofy? Do you have suggestions for
how to talk to him to make him understand my position, or is he just going
to badger me until I miute him?

Tom, I have never received a single IM from Prokofy and neither have any 
of my bots that are in the libsecondlife group, I think your virtual 
quarrels are between you and the person having them. I would venture to 
guess that ideas like "fighting griefing" and "safe programming groups" 
are probably baiting trolls. Just make it clear that you don't speak on 
behalf of libsecondlife in those kind of situations, if you choose to 
engage in dialog at all.

Hello,

Prokofy claims that they have been griefed and harassed several times by
myself. This is of course, false. I treat my Second Life as professionally
as I treat my first. I met Prokofy one time at one of an in-world meetings
they hosted, didn't say anything alarmist (chat logs are available on
Prokofy's site), and then left earlier than I wanted (real life schedule
interfering). The conversation was actually somewhat worthwhile.

Whatever is going on between you and Prokofy is not related to libSL in
the least. If Prokofy is abusing you, then you have the tools made
available from Linden Lab to address this. At the least it includes the
"Mute", and at the other end of the spectrum there is the Abuse Report
functionality.

At this point any efforts to promote "safe" bot use are not related to
libsecondlife. That being said, once these efforts mature, I see no reason
why libsecondlife could not be involved, if not directly associated. I
particularily like the "peer code review" idea for the libsecondlife core.

Dont worry about Prok, shes a paranoid fill-in-the-blanks. People like her
love to spark controversy. I recommend muting her and ignoring her from the
start.

My two cents,

 Prokofy Neva is the zenith archetype of Internet trolls... And that's coming from me, Jarod Godel, an Internet troll. She's technophobic, narrow-minded, and those are her (she is a she) good qualities. Either ignore her or take pleasure in trolling back.

  I've been getting IM's from Prokofy Neva, to the tune of about 30 or so, telling me that I'm somehow responsible for griefers like W-Hat, because I'm a member of the libSecondLife group within Second Life. I offered to talk to him one on one, but he just kept telling me how my reputation is falling because I'm associated with libSL, and that he will hold ME responsible for the W-Hat griefing going on in his land.  
 This attitude is especially frustrating, considering the fact that I've been the most outspoken about forming a group to find ways to fight griefing and "unsafe" programming involving third party SL programs and scripts.    Have others here had experience with Prokofy? Do you have suggestions for how to talk to him to make him understand my position, or is he just going to badger me until I miute him?

I logged in and immediately got assailed with accusations. I'm now a liar,
John and Baba are criminals, and every person in the libSL group supports
griefers, according to Prokofy.

Oh yeah, John and Baba - Prok says you should publicly apologize, step down,
and quit submitting code to libSL.

However, one thing that Prok said is true: Baba's showing copybot around on
the grid and John selling not one but two different controversial programs
(God Mode and Copybot) has caused a lot of controversy. I'm not going to
call either one of them griefers or criminals, but John - I really wish you
hadn't been selling copybot. That made all of us look bad, and considering
the fact that you still haven't made a public apology for that, people
naturally assume that you're happy to profit from would-be griefers.

Perhaps it IS time for John and Baba both to step up, admit fault, take the
blame, and say "we're sorry for the problems this caused. In the future, we
won't do this -  sell or distribute any test programs that can violate
someone else's IP". Don't get me wrong - I don't think Baba intended for
this to happen, but John had to know that selling CopyBot was a bad idea.

Before you think this is all in reaction to Prok, I've received quite a few
disparaging comments that brought my character in to question because I
supported you guys when I thought you hadn't done anyhthing wrong. Finding
out you HAD been selling copybot was like a slap in the face, and
considering the fact that I defended your honor and was proven wrong, not
once but twice, I'm a little upset.

Why didn't I say anything before? Quite frankly, I was hoping it would just
go away. But things like this most recent "conversation" just keep bringing
it back up. When someone says "Why did you defend John, when he was the one
selling it?" I don't have a good answer. All I can say is, "I know he's
sorry," but I can't point to a single public place where John Hurliman steps
up and says "Selling CopyBot was wrong, and I'm sorry I did it."

So now I'm beginning to be sorry that I believed in this group's leaders.
What do I do about that? I don't know yet, but this is a start.

Remember one thing: many people dont believe the good things.. they only
believe and recollect the bad things.. Its true. I think the one who should
apologize is Prokofy herself, she is the one that blew rumours out of
control and made everyone panic (you can quote me on that)

Now, please.. For the sake of everyone, please move this discussion off of
this message board. It is for developers, not wa-waa-waa-waa omg drahma
trolls.

Eek, you've fallen victim to Prokofy-existential-questionism.
Really, it's better off if you just stop worrying and accept the fact
that you're a greifer in Prokofy's eyes. She's not going to change her
view on you even if you step down and renounce libsecondlife (or evict
greifers from the group), I know from personal experience.
She has a very real and very dangerous personality disorder. She will
try to play off your darkest thoughts in demonic and impish ways.
Don't fall victim to her, it only makes her stronger.

Yeah, I've been assailed by her about "powering" various griefer groups 
that I'd honestly never heard of.  And then when I pointed out this 
fact, she got all huffy about trying to deny that they existed...

What I ended up doing is providing her with my SL email address, and 
asked that she email me her concerns and questions and that I would 
address them via email.  She never emailed me, and I haven't heard 
anything since.

I know that announced dates for things don't hold much weight in SL (or 
the net in general), but rumors circulating around say a beta client 
will be released next Wednesday that implements the new REST (https) 
protocol for all of the reliable client->viewer transactions. This would 
be a very good thing and make libsecondlife much more reliable and easy 
to write, but it also means a significant rewrite of most of the 
library. The beta period will probably last a while so when it's 
released we'll fork the code, and hopefully we can gather as many 
programmers, reverse engineers, documentation writers, and testers as 
possible for the rewrite.

Get your rest, I'll see you next week! :-)

Tom,

Prokofy is one of the biggest and most successful trolls in Second Life.
Armed with a thesaurus and knowledge of political rhetoric such as
"bolshevik displacement", her M.O. for winning arguments is to dump a
truckload of words on her opponents until they simply give up from sheer
exhaustion. I would recommend not muting her unless her communications
really get in your way. She has accused me of all manner of dickery in SL,
placed me at the core of many a conspiracy, etc. I'm pretty sure she
actually believes what she's saying, which is a little scary, but at the
end of the day all she has is a dump truck full of words, and words only
have power if you let them.

Ultimately, all she can do is type words at you. If you keep getting
questions from people about libSL, I would recommend creating a new Pick
in your profile and putting a statement in it, and pointing people there.
People shouldn't be mad at you for copybot, since you had nothing to do
with it, and it really isn't necessary for you to apologize for what
John/Baba/whoever did, since again, you weren't involved. In fact, almost
no one in the libSL project had a hand in the creation or distribution of
copybot. People are only mad at the entire group because they are
intellectually lazy.

Hope this helps.

It's a warning, ignore it. Mono doesn't have support for
ServerCertificateValidationCallback, so we have to use the old method
to maintain cross-platform compatibility.

Um, yes, it is well-known that we have efforts afoot to move more "things" 
(messages) to HTTPS, but everything? And next Wednesday? No, sorry, as much 
as I'd like for it to be true :-)

Message-ID: <2296.70.112.218.142.1166032572.squirrel@www.acw.com>

I built the libsecondlife baseline and ran IA_NotecardTool.  It seemed to
run just fine but when I tried to log into SL using the SL client to see
if the new notecard was there I got a "Your account is blocked until XXX"
where XXX was a time in the future.

Has anybody else seen this?  Is this due to not using the SL client to
access SL?  Can SL tell you're not coming in using the SL-provided client?

Thanks for any insight.

Cheers, Scott

It's a problem with logout holding sessions open, there's a bug in the
bugtracker about it.
Just wait for it to clear.

It seems to be possible that libsecondlife can be used to inject an NPC
into SL.  (Well, since it has to log in I guess that it isn't really an
NPC but it is at least not the log-in av and it would be programmatically
controlled.)

Would this be considered socially acceptable by the Linden and the
libsecondsource team?

Thanks for any insight.

I dressed up an alt avatar as a dog using one of the Jakkal collies and 
have been driving it with libSL.  Commands are accepted via chat.  I 
used the AppThatMustNotBeNamed as the basis for this.  I thought it 
would be nice to tell my dog, "Go buy me a beer," and that sort of 
thing.  Don't get too excited, since it's just prototypical code, but 
it's fun.

Actually, since the animations and attachments for avatars vastly 
surpass in quantity and quality all of the inanimate/prim-based pets, 
it's very nice.  And since the avatar code runs just fine on a much 
smaller, slower machine, it's a big win all 'round.

NPCs are acceptable, they're one of the reasons libsl was created.

This must be some novel use of the word "inject" of which I was not  
previously aware.

SL can be an addictive place I'm told. Just looks like a terminal window

I'm looking for someone to work with in creating a new version of SecondView. See www.SecondVita.com 
What I want
* someone who has a vision for what SecondView / SecondLife could be
* Knows C#, SQL, and LSL (at least 2 of these very well)
I am a very experience developer (founded a successful 150-person software startup in a past life) who is trying to enhance SecondLife experience and possibly make some money in the process. My current plan is to extend SecondView to support advertising, and other interesting possibilities.

Hello all,

 

I would like to contribute to development of LSL.

 

However, I am a newbie to second-life, to C# and LSL.  I have a Masters in
EE and I have done coded in university but I have no industrial experience.
I would like to gain experience coding in C#.  I have played around with
second-life and open croquet and thought that the subject of virtual worlds
was really cool.  Therefore, I would like to contribute to LSL, with the
eventual goal of contributing as a developer.  Is there any low level grunt
work I could begin with?.

Hang out in our IRC channel #libsl-dev on EFNet to get more acquainted. 
Also for reference, avoid using LSL as an abbreviation for libsecondlife 
as it is more commonly used to describe the Linden Scripting Language 
(LSL) that is used in Second Life, and not at all related to libsecondlife.

Great to hear your interest. Yea, libsl is a better abbreviation than LSL.
:P

I recommend grabbing a hold of Visual Studio C# Express (you can do a google
search and download it directly from Microsoft's website) and then download
the whole SVN trunk of libsl which you can find here:
http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=7710

Play around with that and get aquinted with VS C# Express. Pop into the
libsl IRC channel and feel free to ask questions there. We will try to
answer them for ya

Please respond off-list unless you really want to talk to everybody. We get enough spam as it is. I've gotten some good responses, but I'm sorry that it has generated some cross talk here. 

If I understand the question right, it is what SecondView has to do with libSL. One small part of SecondView uses libSL, and I have contributed to the libSL development. That is one reason why I thought this would be a good place to post my request for collaboration.

ciao, Felix

A number of people here use the SVN from http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org .

There's also an inworld libsecondlife group.

The group HQ is in the Hooper sim, secondlife://Hooper/195/41/27 .

this list has little enough traffic... Might as well liven it up with a 
discussion of what your thing does...  ;0

Probably the image uploads are using libsecondlife?

Yes, I do use libSL for image upload. I've also experimented with the Media
Image URL. I'm assuming that at some point SL will support HTTP/JPEG or HTML

some other projects as well.

Did you ever find the answer to whether or not the DTD for LLSD had 
changed since it was originally posted at 
http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/07/19/web-services-serialization-format/ 
? I was thinking about laying some initial framework for the REST stuff 
and wanted to know if our documentation was up to date. Also is there 
any sort of timeline for REST functionality in clients, as in Q1 07, Q2 
07, after Havok 2? ;-)

Subject: [Libsecondlife-dev] SL Proxy Mega Cache?
Message-ID: <458A400B.1030008@laserfur.com>

How hard would it be to make a proxy server that
caches 100's of Gigs of textures for multiple clients?

Caching objects would also be nice. I see that there
is a checksum packet that could be used for this. :)

  I would rather see Grey ghosts for 30 seconds when
I enter a sim than nothing. If the cache did cache
objects it could send the objects to the client with
the grey texture UUID until it verifys that that
object still exists.

  LL may improve the client cache, but they are unlikely
to make a separate cache server (any time soon) that can
store 100's of gigs of storage space and can be used
by multiple clients at the same time.

--
I am also worried about texture theft, so I am thinking
that using simple encryption to encrypt the cache
and not releasing that part of the code. This would help
reduce issues like the AppThatMustNotBeNamed.

I know that releasing the encrypt/decrypt module in binary
form would not prevent all copying, but I think that LL will
inevitably encrypt everything.

--
I prefer multiple directory system and a "manually ran"
program that trims old data and sorts the objects in each file
You would then de-fragment the hard drive since this method will
fragment files as it goes.

The master "UUID,resolution" to "dir,file,offset" table could
get quite large, but keeping textures that are loaded at about
the same time in the same file would speed things up.

"Sort as you go" would work, but would be more tricky.

It would be interesting to see how client-side encryption like the cache 
would be successful with the open source client in 2007 that Cory 
mentioned yesterday at the SL town hall.

Databases were invented to solve all of these problems, maybe that would 
be a better way to go?

It is possible to have both an open source client and a
"Trusted" main grid.

LL could set up two completely separate persistent grids
that would not share anything except for account information.

1. The "Trusted Main grid" would only send FullPerm
items to clients not compiled by LL.
  The LL "Trusted" client would have an "encryption class"
that would both encrypt the pipeline and the cache.

2. The "Open source" grid would allow any client to connect
and the "encryption class" would be an empty wrapper class.

A "proxy cache" could cache the items without being able
to actually know what they are if LL implements the
pipeline encryption at the object/item level.

Requirements
  1. Muti-platform
  2. Free
  3. Fast
  4. Compiled in to application to prevent OS conflicts.
  5. Able to handle 1T byte on a low end PC (multiple drives)

Yes. A database is part of the task, but the question is to
use something that already exists or "roll your own" to
better tailor it to the task.

I got a bad taste with M$ Access.

No matter which database you use it will have the same problems.
The key to speed will be moving items to cluster them next to
each other based on usage in order to reduce hard drive seeking.

One suggestion on the forum was to use one directory per sim.
Even though that would store the same textures multiple times
it would be faster.

Message-ID: <458AA369.6080904@wsu.edu>

We haven't officially made any hints about libsecondlife being ready for 
production use, but that hasn't stopped the early adopters. Yesterday 
the band Long Range did a concert in SL, and the technical workings were 
pretty interesting. The band was live in a studio streaming a Quicktime 
feed in-world with video and audio of the performance, but the band 
member avatars were operated by libsecondlife. The bots were programmed 
to login, hunt for their target pose stand and sit on it which would 
begin the animation. This is nothing different from the sit command in 
TestClient or some of the other code people have been working on, but 
the interesting part is that the concert was split up between 12 
identical sims synchronized together that all needed band members 
playing. Five band members times 12 sims is 60 libsecondlife bots, and 
they were all running from one server! There were a couple glitches with 
the appearances being sent out that I'm chalking up to network load 
issues (logging in 60 avs at the same time), but overall the concert(s) 
went really well. A video is available at:

The library is approaching production state, watch out for lots of cool 
things this month!

Heh, almost fell off my chair when you mentioned MS Access while talking 
about databases.

Although MS Access organizes data and functions as a "database" -- it's 
meant to be a tool for organizing relatively small amounts of personal 
data, while running in user space.  It has been horribly abused over the 
years in attempts to make it do much more then it was originally 
designed for.

Any trivially implemented attempt at a real database engine will vastly 
outperform MS Access, in nearly all respects.  Any well thought out and 
implemented attempt at a real database engine will show exactly how much 
of a "toy" MS Access is.

The major Open Source database engines (MySQL/Postgress) when properly 
configured can satisfy all of your requirements except possibly #4:

Requirements
   1. Muti-platform
   2. Free
   3. Fast
   4. Compiled in to application to prevent OS conflicts.
   5. Able to handle 1T byte on a low end PC (multiple drives)


A common shared SL Proxy may improve grid/sim performance by taking the 
load of delivering textures off the grid/sim -- which if used by enough 
people could improve grid performance.  I'm not so sure it would help 
improve the client's performance much though.  Could be useful if you 
had a Internet cafe or something in RL, where you had a large number of 
people in RL all visiting the same sim though.

All that said...  Making a caching proxy using SLProxy shouldn't take 
more then 10 or 20 hours of development time.  Probably much less then 
that, to get a "functioning" prototype built.

That serialization formation is still heavily in use, unchanged, and  
gaining more use quickly in code and serialization. Currently, the  
serialization format is only used for communication between back-end  
services. Director support for interfacing the viewer to the grid is  
coming early next year.

Encryption is dumb. Any usefully strong encryption would slow things to 
intolerable levels. Bad encryption just slows things down for no reason.

Subject: [Libsecondlife-dev] Creator's name from CreatorID ?
Message-ID: <d364a9ec0612211344g70ed082fvd7fcf892f9ef943b@mail.gmail.com>

In the file iManager.cs, which is in
...\libsecondlife-cs\examples\IA_InventoryManager there is a line that
diplays an inventory item's CreatorId.  I would like to change this so as to
display the creator's name instead.
The line I want to change is:
Console.WriteLine( "<" + item.CreatorID.ToStringHyphenated() + "> " +"<"+
item.Name + ">" ) ;

Thanks for your time.

Thanks, Phoenix.  Was going to post once I had spoken to you and Zero.

That's really just a debugging output  ;0   You usually have to do a 
name request block to get names from UUIDs, though there should be an 
easier way.

I think the library should set up the callback an cache keys etc..   
Retrieving names from keys is a pretty much default requrement, but 
probably should not be part of the minimal session.

What's the thought on that?

Actually, no it isn't debugging output.  IA_Manager/iManager.exe is a 
command line interface to your inventory/bot.

What Suezanne is referring to is the output you get when you do LS or 
DIR, and use one of the available switches: /itemid /assetid  ...etc

Although, I think you may be using the old version where that's output 
no matter what, rather then only when doing a switch.  Or perhaps your 
looking at one of the other commands (I don't have access to my code 
where I'm @ right now.)

I should be able to add creator's name.  I'll take a look at it either 
tomorrow or perhaps early next week.

Random modification? Yeah right!
EULA  + Banstick is pretty much all they can do

Excellent.

When you look at the properties of an inventory item in SL, you can see the
values of Name, Description, Creator, Owner,  Acquired, share with group,
allow anyone to copy,  permissions,  and price.

My personal interest lies in  the item name, creator name, and
description, but other folks might find the other fields useful. Folks who
sell stuff might like to see the permissions of objects, for example.

Output to a comma delimited text file, or other such form that can be used
in a spreadsheet or database programs would be nice.

I have a feeling that you can't get at the properties that show in the
object editor,
like size or what textures it has, unless you rez the object, right?

Suezanne, I should have a blocking name request function here once I
stop being lazy and test it out beyond just seeing that it compiles.

Hmmm, found the link.  Seems I misread "attribution" as "attrition", so what
I read was:

"As for the elements that you can copy, such as shape and texture, Rosedale
explains: "What we're going to do is add a lot of attrition. You'll be able
to easily see [...] if something is a later copy. This should be ready
"within a couple of months". Libsecondlife's Jonathan Freedman says the
project will "support any new standards" that are introduced to maintain
"the sanctity of intellectual property"."

Obviously, means something different with the original word ;-)

Correct, but that's accomplished using more then a single packet.  Most 
of the Inventory* classes are built with the data returned from 
InventoryUpdate and InventoryDescendant packets, which don't include the 
name of owners/creators.  I should be able to use Jesse's new blocking 
function to provide it.

Although, Jesse, you may wish to add an optional timeout 
.GetAvatarName(uuid, [timeout])

and pass that into .WaitOne(), and have the function return null or 
throw an exception if it times out.

Currently it's possible to output your inventory to XML, which MS-Excel 
& MS-Access 2K3/2K7 should be able to open.  Copying the iManager LS/DIR 
command and having it output to a CSV file would be trivial.

I haven't looked at Asset storage format for objects yet.

That would be a good idea to add a timeout, but I do believe my code
has been replaced *grumblegrumble*

Why do you lock you house door at night?
Don't you know that my 15 pound maul can easily open it?
And if that doesn't... AN+fuel= real brute force attack.
(end rhetorical)

It's not technical matter... but a LEGAL one.

In order to enforce parts of the DMCA (or similar laws in
other country's) you have to show intent. The DMCA makes it
a crime to divulge information about how to circumvent copy
protection systems. It does not specify how strong the
encryption has to be.

I am saying that simply compiling in a random 256 byte sequence
and XOR'ing the data would comply with the legal requirements.
  data = data XOR m_key[i AND 0xFF];

"Using HTTP proxy caches for textures: Outside of Linden Lab?s
networks, no.
  Access to textures still requires an authenticated, secure channel,
and HTTP doesn?t allow caching in those cases (since the cache
itself isn?t authenticated)."

This implies that LL will not allow a separate proxy cache
system unless the cache is secure.

  A separate proxy cache system would benefit a lot of users.
You would get performance improvements even if you only had
one client connected since users could use a second
(probably older) PC to cache the data.

Has anybody seen a change in the behavior of physical object interaction
in \ release of 1.13.1?

I have an object that is a link of about 12 boards.  I put another
physical object -- a ball -- on the boards and expect it to roll around. 
And it used to before 1.13.1.

Now the ball just falls through the boards.  Keep in mind the ball and the
boards are ticked 'physical'.

Any suggestions?

Thanks for any insight.

Cheers, Scott

Has the joint state machine for getting an SL client and the SL server
mutually up and running been worked out?

Examining a number of boot sequence traces, one can discern some ping-pong
style regularities along with some speed control behavior but I can't make
out the states yet let alone the transitions.

For example, as a very basic question, how does the client know that the
server is done sending it cache information so that it can finish
digesting what it has and turn control over to the user?

Thanks in advance for any insight.

The login code should have most of the answers for you. The official
client just blockingly downloads your clothes and starts dl-ing
textures in the area I do believe.

The server is never done sending information, it's constantly streamed 
for the entire connection. The turning point in the official client 
appears to be when the clothing assets have finished downloading and the 
appearance is sent back to the server. There's nothing fundamentally 
stopping you from moving around and doing things before that, but SL is 
less enjoyable if you can't see your avatar.

I was unclear.  I was thinking of the transition between the initial cache
update & priming phase and steady state message shuffling.  I've noticed
that the server seems to idle by sending the client StartPingChecks to let
the client digest what it has been sent and ask for anything additional it
thinks it could use.  The transition seems to be when 1) the client's
CompletePingCheck is up-to-date, 2) the client isn't making any more
requests and 3) the server has no additional precache information to send.
 Now we're at a quiescent steady state and the games can begin.

What is your definition of idle? At that point the server would be 
sending the client LayerData packets to describe the terrain/wind/clouds 
and ObjectUpdate + other object packets to describe the surrounding 
world, along with handling any requests from the client for more data. I 
guess I'm not following what you are trying to find?

Yes, and that's exactly what I'm imagining is a state-machine driven boot
sequence.  You can watch the server proceed serially through all the
LayerData types from 1 to 55, sometimes doing nothing at a particular type
and moving quickly onto the next and sometimes dropping off some
ObjectUpdates, ImageDatas, AgentAnimations and so forth at a particular
level.

I was imagining that the client was following along in synchrony and would
stop at a level (by not ACKing) to make additional requests at that level.
 This is the state machine that my addled mind's eye was trying to see in
the fog.

Cheers, Scott

1) Is all of terraformation tied up in the TerrainBase and TerrainDetail
fields of RegionHandshake?

2) Has anybody decoded these byte blobs?

3) Are there any viewer -> sim messages that updates these values when one
does terraformation?  The logical candidate is ParcelPropertiesUpdate but
it doesn't seem to concern itself with TerrainBase and TerrainDetail.

Thanks for any insight.

LayerData is where the terrain data is at, and it's wierd. several
people had kinda half-working parsers at one time.

You can see in the protocol file 
(http://www.libsecondlife.org/template/release/1.13.0.10.txt) 
TerrainBase* and TerrainDetail* fields are LLUUIDs, they point to 
terrain textures that apply to the entire sim. The TerrainStartHeight* 
and TerrainHeightRange* fields describe at what elevations those 
textures apply, and the implementation in the client uses a pretty fancy 
terrain splatting algorithm that uses those values as seed values 
combined with some alpha masks to generate more realistic looking 
terrain texture blends. If by terraformation you mean the heightmap of 
the region, you need LayerData packets. 
http://www.libsecondlife.org/protocol/index.php/LayerData for more 
information on those, which will answer your next question.

Partially, see above. We are awaiting a third party contribution as well 
that should give us some more progress.

I don't remember off the top of my head which packet, but the client 
doesn't get the ability to upload LayerData packets or describe exactly 
how to terraform the terrain. The region owner uploads the original RAW 
terrain file, and parcel owners can terraform by sending commands to the 
sim which amount to "use this brush size and this tool, and push in this 
direction for this duration of time and we'll see what happens".

Trying to grab the latest snapshot from berlios, and it appears to be down
as of 10:30pm EST.  And what's up with the IRC channel on EFnet, anyone
actually hang out on here anymore?  It's empty atm, not even a bot.

Hey Bobby,

Berlios has been having some issues, try https instead of http for the
website portion, and svn instead of http or https for working with the
repository. #libsl does still have people in it, just we are occasionally
idle. We are trying to keep a bot running as well to tie the chat into the
build we have in Hooper.

Cheers

I have to admit I was on the wrong irc network.  Woops.

Thanks for the tip about getting some functionality out of berlios in its
current state.

Details: <@jhurliman> qz4200, we just started having that problem too after the latest SL patch. we may have to redo the logout code
 <@jhurliman> technically we are supposed to do LogoutRequest, wait for LogoutReply, then do FinalizeLogout. i think

Comment:
Added proper support for logout. LogoutRequest -> LogoutReply -> LogoutDemand (or skip straight to LogoutDemand). Done in r778

Is there a way to tell the viewer that it needs to delete its cache?

Thanks for any insight.

Cheers, Scott

I don't think that there is one, I think that the client is
responsible for any and all caching done.

I see that there is a checksum command for objects(prims), but
it appears that LL client clears the object cache at startup.

The cache should have a "cache version number" so that if
the data format changes, the application can delete it.
-
note cards, textures, animations and sounds are all static and get
a new UUID if changed. The cache should delete the oldest based on
the "last time used" when trimming it's size.

--
Objects should be cached based on a flag system since the client
only gets updates when you are around.
  The "in world" objects should be sorted by which 32m box it is in
and then when entering a box all the objects should be flagged.
If the sim does not update the object within 1 minute or so, remove
it from the object cache.

  There is a way to have the cache check the sim for the existence
of a object by using the packet to request the CRC, but due to possible
updates during the process, it is simpler to get the objects as it
streams and remove ghosts by removing objects if you get the same UUID
elsewhere in the sim or if not seen after x seconds.

Does the term "Script" in such message names as:

ScriptAnswerYes
ScriptQuestion
ScriptControlChange
ForceScriptControlRelease
SetScriptRunning
ScriptReset
RezScript

ScriptDialogReply
ScriptDialog

have any relationship to LSL scripts?  If so, since ScriptDialog is
sim->viewer and ScriptDialogReply is viewer->sim, does this mean that
a sim can trigger the running LSL script on a viewer and retrieve
the results?

Also if so, does RezScript mean a sim can inject an LSL script into
an object and then run it as above?

Thanks for any insight.

Cheers, Scott
