ScriptDialog / ScriptDialogReply are for dialog boxes created by scripts 
that ask an avatar a question and the avatar presses a button to reply. 
The viewer doesn't have an LSL interpreter and no actual LSL bytecode is 
ever sent to viewers, scripts are all run on the simulators. If I recall 
RezScript was a viewer->sim command that tells the sim to instantiate a 
script that's been put in to the inventory of an object in a simulator, 
but I'm not positive. You can find a lot of this out with SLProxy and 
some trial and error.

Subject: [Libsecondlife-dev] [Bug #9863] Rename Logout to RequestLogout and
	add a blocking Logout
Message-ID: <200701040919.l049JPVW006862@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #9863, was updated on 2007-Jan-04 01:19
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: libsecondlife
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: Incomplete Code
Priority: 3
Submitted by: jhurliman
Assigned to : jhurliman
Summary: Rename Logout to RequestLogout and add a blocking Logout

Details: The NetworkManager.Logout function currently does not block, but many example programs and applications are using it like it does. To follow the design of the rest of the library, this asynchronous function should be renamed to RequestLogout() and a Logout() function added that blocks with a ManualResetEvent and a timeout value added to Settings.

Comment:
I believe the NullReferenceException in the IM callback was checking against the Master LLUUID when it was not set (null). This has been fixed and I'll assume the bug closed.

Details: The following code should return the same RegionHandle for all three variables:

Console.WriteLine("Sim:  " + simulator.Region.Handle);

However, when run inside hooper by a bot with latest SVN, the first handle returned by simulator.Region.Handle is not equal to the one returned by the other two variables.

I'm not sure which set is incorrect.

In addition, there could be an easy way to accept or decline inventory offers, but that's just a plus. :)

Comment:
okay, the problem has been tracked down to the Region class inside of Simulator is not getting it's Region Handle set correctly.  And it's simply getting set to your avatar's home region handle.

Hello List,

LL has announced the opening of the viewer source code. This is a good
thing, and does not mean the end of libsecondlife. There are many areas
which LL likely has no interest in pursuing, but which will be possible
with a more generic library such as we are aiming for with libsecondlife.

That being said, I'm sure we will make use of  some of this recently
released source.

Details on the blob @

Hi,

I have been lurking here for a while :)

Jonathan Freedman wrote.."This is a good thing, and does not mean the end of
libsecondlife."

I agree with Jonathan...the open source client  should make libsecondlife
easier to implement since you don't have to reverse-engineer everything now
but also creates some opportunities.

One thing that came to mind is a having libsecondlife become a cohesive
object model for alternate SL clients. libsecondlife could follow the
pattern of the relationship between the Win32 API and the .NET Framework.
Most people choose to use the .NET Framework instead of the Win32 API simply
because the framework is a lot more approachable than the API - you can
accomplish the same tasks in both cases, but faster and with fewer bugs than
when you use the API directly.

Also, just because the client is open source does not mean that everyone can
immediately start creating their own SL clients - still need to analyze,
walk through various scenarios, etc. A libsecondlife object model would go a
long way to making SL more of a platform.

It's also important to note that libsecondlife is under a more liberal 
license (BSD) than the viewer which will be released under the GPL. This 
means there are scenarios where libsecondlife would make sense to use 
and code adapted from the official viewer might not, and it also means 
we need to be careful about pulling code out of the viewer and sticking 
it in libsl.

I do not agree with "more liberal", because I say GPL protects
liberty, while BSD licenses do not. But never mind.

I am VERY happy about this move. I now would really love to make a
definitive FLOSS meeting.

I suggest tuesday 9th january at 9pm PST/SL Time. Where? Somebody make
a suggestion. I will invite all those who are members of free software
group.

if other time or day is better please suggest.

Though I referred to a license as liberal recently, it is not a good  
adjective for comparison between licenses. In comparing 'free'  
licenses along the axis of 'liberated' I would argue that BSD  
liberates the developers while the GPL 2 liberates the code.

I suggest we make a little meeting after the technical talk to day
after Cory Lindens technical talk at 3pm. Amybe at Atlas 61,200 where
there is a repeater. Or maybe choose yet another place spontaneously.

That would be a good idea, but most people are already familiar with our 
plot in Hooper. Maybe we can start in Hooper and move if it gets crowded?

Any time you are parsing a number from a string you should sanity check 
with exception handling around just that operation, or use a TryParse() 
function. I have to run now otherwise I'd fix it, maybe I will get to it 
later this evening.

Details: The NetworkManager.Logout function currently does not block, but many example programs and applications are using it like it does. To follow the design of the rest of the library, this asynchronous function should be renamed to RequestLogout() and a Logout() function added that blocks with a ManualResetEvent and a timeout value added to Settings.

Ayup!

This the code for reading wearable assets was submitted by someone else, 
I have yet to run into this particular error (I don't have any wearables 
that exhibit it.)  If the wearable is copy'able I could use a copy of it 
(dropped on Bot Ringo) so I can try to understand why the number isn't 
where the decoder is expecting it.

I will see if I can get a copy of one of the outfits from the bot owner 
(I just work here). Running 10 bots with 10 similar but different 
outfits, and it seems that all 10 had the same error. Would it be easier 
to change the line to spit debugging output if it has an error?

That would work fine.

At some point there the asset's text is being broken up by some code 
that Qode wrote.  I don't have a copy handy right now, but I believe it 
starts chunking it with string splits.

It would help if you could get an output of, I think the variable name 
was: wholeEnchilada or something like that, as well as an error message 
isolating what number/string it's choking on specifically.

So... after today's update will we just be needing a version number
increment in our login code? :-)
Lots of questions:
How's caps support coming?
Will the 1.13.2 viewer update obsolete all the old messaging code? If not,
how much will it obsolete? Will the old code still work?

My sincerest apologies if these have all been answered already.

Old code should still work, the grid is supposedly running in
compatibility mode where the old stuff still works. IIRC, region
crossings are handled by CAPS, as well as map blocks. There's not much
to break so far :D

Looks like a necessary part of the teleport mechanism was switched to 
require CAPS, and the main libsl trunk doesn't support that mechanism yet.

Should be 100% fallback on the message system.  I would report it as a 
bug if it's not accepting UDP messages for teleports.

libsl is waiting on a merge from our aditi branch. clients are supposed to
fallback if CAPS is disabled, but that relies on the client being able to
negotiate this fact with the sim. this code is in our aditi branch.

Nope; on the server side we have the ability to fall back to the UDP 
message for teleports. However, if caps are turned on in the server, you 
have to use them to teleport. Sorry.

This is due to changes in the SL protocol, specifically the addition of CAPS. We had teleports working the preview grid, but it looks like some changes went live that did not see the public preview grid. As of now it is still broken.

I fixed the MapLayerRequest failing, it was an outdated message template. Everything is updated to the latest protocol but it looks like we're still having some issues with the Caps support so teleports don't complete and may leave avatars in limbo right now. I upgraded this to a high priority issue and hopefully it will be resolved soon.

Details: The following code should return the same RegionHandle for all three variables:

{
Console.WriteLine("Sim:  " + simulator.Region.Handle);
Console.WriteLine("Prim: " + NewPrim.RegionHandle);

======

However, when run inside hooper by a bot with latest SVN, the first handle returned by simulator.Region.Handle is not equal to the one returned by the other two variables.

I'm not sure which set is incorrect.

okay, the problem has been tracked down to the Region class inside of Simulator is not getting it's Region Handle set correctly.  And it's simply getting set to your avatar's home region handle.

Message-ID: <200701191335.l0JDZSS4023310@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #9888, was updated on 2007-Jan-06 16:44

Summary: RegionHandle not being set correctly in Simulator.Region

Details: The following code should return the same RegionHandle for all three variables:

==========
protected void Objects_OnNewPrim(Simulator simulator, PrimObject NewPrim, ulong regionHandle, ushort timeDilation)
{
Console.WriteLine("Sim:  " + simulator.Region.Handle);
Console.WriteLine("Prim: " + NewPrim.RegionHandle);
Console.WriteLine("RgnH: " + regionHandle);
======

However, when run inside hooper by a bot with latest SVN, the first handle returned by simulator.Region.Handle is not equal to the one returned by the other two variables.

I'm not sure which set is incorrect.

Comment:
I fixed the MapLayerRequest failing, it was an outdated message template. Everything is updated to the latest protocol but it looks like we're still having some issues with the Caps support so teleports don't complete and may leave avatars in limbo right now. I upgraded this to a high priority issue and hopefully it will be resolved soon.

Comment:
This is due to changes in the SL protocol, specifically the addition of CAPS. We had teleports working the preview grid, but it looks like some changes went live that did not see the public preview grid. As of now it is still broken.

Getting closer, I fixed an endian issue in the teleport routine. Still can't successfully teleport though, not sure what's going on. Do we have to do something different now?
